- Looks like the motor-driver doesn't want / need the 3.3v from the ESP8266 but rather the 5V in from the step down
- Pulling from the 3.3v cause curren increase
- Not pulling from the buck converter 5v side causes current spike
- Seems happiest when gettin the same as Vin in the ESP. 
  - I assume this is only because it wants to run at 5v logic instead of 3.3v
  - I haven't noticed any LSP298 logic hiccups from over-voltage for upperend YET
- Turns out L298n can run at 3.3v logic no problem
- Pulling 5v enable pin and feeding from buck converter is good call
